== Usage

=== File Structure

All files located within this project provide the basic structure/blueprint for creating new Bash
script projects. The structure is organized as follows:

....
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGES.adoc          # The details of past version releases.
â”œâ”€â”€ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc  # Guidelines for encouraging harassment-free contributions.
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.adoc     # The details of how to contribute to the project.
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE.adoc          # The license and copyright legalities of the project.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.adoc           # The project overview, setup, usage, testing, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ bin                   # A folder for executable Bash scripts.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ run               # The main run script (which loads the lib and settings).
â”œâ”€â”€ lib                   # A folder for Bash functions and custom code.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ cli.sh            # Provides CLI prompt options for the main `run` script.
â”œâ”€â”€ settings              # The global/project settings for easy manipulation/tweaking.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.sh           # The global settings (set with safe defaults).
....

=== Template

The following documents what each template option is:

[source,bash]
----
# Exit, with error message, when attempting to use an undefined variable.
# Alias: `set -u`.
set -o nounset

# Abort script at first error when a command exits with non-zero status.
# Alias: `set -e`.
set -o errexit

# Return exit status of the last command in the pipe that returned a non-zero return value.
set -o pipefail

# Defines newlines and tabs as delimiters for splitting words and iterating arrays.
IFS=$'\n\t'
----

=== Debugging

For debugging purposes, you can add the following option:

[source,bash]
----
# Prints all executed commands.
# Alias: `set -x`.
set -o xtrace
----

The above is useful for debugging purposes but probably not something you want always enabled.

ðŸ’¡ For additional options, use `help set` to learn more.
